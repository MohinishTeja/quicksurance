## Inspiration
Intact Insurance has the been the leader of INsurance market in Canada. their promise of 30minute claim process is very good for customers and hard for company to keep up. But with new technologies coming everyday this task will be easy for them to fulfill and gain more customers with their cutting edge technology based services.
## What it does
Dot is a website created to demonstrate the new technologies that can be incorporated with Intact Insurance for greater User Experience and faster Claim processing. This project can be divided intotwo parts.
* Image Recognition for faster assesment of damage and clearer picture.
    * So a customer who claims for a say Car insurance uploads his damage pictures for Insurance claim. But there is no guarantee that he uploads exact pictures needed to asses the damage and Insurance company can't just reject claim as they are nont good and need to keep up with 30min time limit. So we have used Open CV with Python to make blurred images more clearer and so on. With this Intact can correctly measure the damage and process the claim in time and maybe even faster!
    
* Voice based assistant for User Experience
    * Users might have an APp for Intact Insurance and they can track their claim status and al the details regarding their insurrance. But it lacks the human touch of agent who clarifies the doubts of this lengthy process. So we have added a Voice assistant which can tell about latest plans, about the company and even purchase insurance. This is tool really brings in lot of ease to User Experience.

## How we built it
We used Python along with OpenCV for Image recognition and correction part.We have used Voice assistant and Frontend technologies for the website part.It has the following tools
* Image recognition
  * Python
  * OpenCV
    * Makes Blurred images to more understandable format
    * Even helps in identfying number plates and other details
  
* Voice Assistant

Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JS
* Bootstrap Framework
  * Use of JQuery
  * Use of SmartForm for Contact
  * Frontend Framework

GitHub
  * File Management
  * Hosting
 Node Js

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we ran into, but that's what programming's all about. One of the difficult challenges we ran into was making sure the image reogniton technology works and makes it easier for us to look. Also we have struggled a lot with integrating Image Recogniser to website and couldn't complete it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of so many things. We made use of this project to the best of our abilities in this 36 hours of time. We got to use the OpenCV, which is a first for all of us, we had never used OpenCV before and now we will continue to use this platform. Additionally, we combined all of our skills to create a website that use multiple frameworks and we are proud of this website. We love the UI/UX and we love the Backend, it was our first time as well using these frameworks. Finally, we are proud of the amount of work we pulled of in 36 hours. We would have never thought we could accmplish this much in such a small amount of time.

## What we learned
* Creating realtime databases
* OpenCV
* User Authentication
* Voice Assistant for website manipulation and data transfer

## What's next for Dot
* Make a good Website
* Add all kinds of backend features for database storage.
* Integrate Image recognition tech to website
